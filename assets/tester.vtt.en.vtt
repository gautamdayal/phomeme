00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 align:start position:0%
thought perhaps to tell the story of how
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 align:start position:0%

I<00:00:30.359><c> sort</c><00:00:31.140><c> of</c><00:00:31.199><c> came</c><00:00:31.349><c> to</c><00:00:31.560><c> be</c><00:00:31.679><c> here</c><00:00:31.890><c> how</c><00:00:32.070><c> did</c><00:00:32.189><c> some</c>

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 align:start position:0%
I sort of came to be here how did some
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370 align:start position:0%
I sort of came to be here how did some

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
of these things happen and and maybe
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
of these things happen and and maybe
there's<00:00:34.649><c> some</c><00:00:34.860><c> lessons</c><00:00:35.309><c> there</c><00:00:36.149><c> because</c><00:00:36.899><c> I</c>

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 align:start position:0%
there's some lessons there because I
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 align:start position:0%
there's some lessons there because I
often<00:00:37.469><c> find</c><00:00:37.620><c> myself</c><00:00:37.739><c> wondering</c><00:00:38.370><c> how</c><00:00:38.489><c> did</c><00:00:38.550><c> this</c>

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
often find myself wondering how did this
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.130 align:start position:0%
often find myself wondering how did this
happen

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
happen
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.290 align:start position:0%
happen
so<00:00:41.600><c> when</c><00:00:42.600><c> I</c><00:00:42.629><c> was</c><00:00:42.809><c> young</c><00:00:43.320><c> I</c><00:00:43.500><c> I</c><00:00:44.370><c> didn't</c><00:00:45.149><c> really</c>

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
so when I was young I I didn't really
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
so when I was young I I didn't really
know<00:00:45.390><c> what</c><00:00:45.539><c> I</c><00:00:45.600><c> was</c><00:00:45.690><c> going</c><00:00:45.840><c> to</c><00:00:45.899><c> do</c><00:00:46.020><c> we're</c><00:00:46.739><c> not</c>

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 align:start position:0%
know what I was going to do we're not
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 align:start position:0%
know what I was going to do we're not
when<00:00:46.920><c> I</c><00:00:46.950><c> got</c><00:00:47.129><c> older</c><00:00:47.399><c> people</c><00:00:48.270><c> kept</c><00:00:48.420><c> asking</c><00:00:48.750><c> me</c>

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
when I got older people kept asking me
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
when I got older people kept asking me
and<00:00:48.960><c> and</c><00:00:49.700><c> but</c><00:00:50.700><c> then</c><00:00:50.850><c> eventually</c><00:00:51.270><c> I</c><00:00:51.449><c> thought</c>

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 align:start position:0%
and and but then eventually I thought
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 align:start position:0%
and and but then eventually I thought
that<00:00:51.719><c> the</c><00:00:51.960><c> idea</c><00:00:52.050><c> of</c><00:00:52.199><c> inventing</c><00:00:52.590><c> things</c><00:00:53.010><c> would</c>

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
that the idea of inventing things would
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.470 align:start position:0%
that the idea of inventing things would
be<00:00:53.730><c> would</c><00:00:54.180><c> be</c><00:00:54.329><c> really</c><00:00:54.539><c> cool</c><00:00:54.809><c> and</c><00:00:56.180><c> the</c><00:00:57.180><c> reason</c><00:00:57.420><c> I</c>

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
be would be really cool and the reason I
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
be would be really cool and the reason I
thought<00:00:57.629><c> that</c><00:00:57.809><c> was</c><00:00:57.930><c> because</c><00:00:58.230><c> I</c><00:00:59.480><c> read</c><00:01:00.480><c> a</c><00:01:00.510><c> quote</c>

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 align:start position:0%
thought that was because I read a quote
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.789 align:start position:0%
thought that was because I read a quote
from<00:01:00.809><c> Odyssey</c><00:01:01.770><c> clock</c><00:01:02.129><c> which</c><00:01:02.399><c> said</c><00:01:02.670><c> that</c><00:01:02.699><c> a</c>

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
from Odyssey clock which said that a
 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.469 align:start position:0%
from Odyssey clock which said that a
sufficiently<00:01:04.799><c> advanced</c><00:01:05.700><c> technology</c><00:01:05.850><c> is</c>

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
sufficiently advanced technology is
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable<00:01:06.659><c> from</c><00:01:07.350><c> magic</c><00:01:07.530><c> and</c><00:01:08.070><c> and</c>

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from magic and and
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from magic and and
that's<00:01:09.119><c> really</c><00:01:09.180><c> true</c><00:01:10.040><c> if</c><00:01:11.040><c> you</c><00:01:11.250><c> think</c><00:01:11.430><c> if</c><00:01:11.490><c> you</c>

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's really true if you think if you
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.539 align:start position:0%
that's really true if you think if you
go<00:01:11.670><c> back</c><00:01:11.750><c> say</c><00:01:12.750><c> 300</c><00:01:13.229><c> years</c><00:01:13.470><c> the</c><00:01:14.070><c> things</c><00:01:14.280><c> that</c><00:01:14.430><c> we</c>

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 align:start position:0%
go back say 300 years the things that we
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
go back say 300 years the things that we

and and I thought well that that would
 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and I thought well that that would

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.450 align:start position:0%
get people really excited and and and
 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
get people really excited and and and
therefore<00:07:35.810><c> increase</c><00:07:36.110><c> with</c><00:07:36.289><c> NASA's</c><00:07:36.620><c> budget</c><00:07:36.770><c> so</c>

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
therefore increase with NASA's budget so
 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
therefore increase with NASA's budget so
so<00:07:38.060><c> obviously</c><00:07:38.330><c> the</c><00:07:38.750><c> financial</c><00:07:39.139><c> outcome</c><00:07:39.620><c> from</c>

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 align:start position:0%
so obviously the financial outcome from
 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.700 align:start position:0%
so obviously the financial outcome from
such<00:07:39.979><c> a</c><00:07:40.010><c> mission</c><00:07:40.250><c> would</c><00:07:40.460><c> probably</c><00:07:40.760><c> be</c><00:07:40.880><c> zero</c><00:07:41.710><c> so</c>

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.710 align:start position:0%
such a mission would probably be zero so
 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.290 align:start position:0%
such a mission would probably be zero so
anything<00:07:43.039><c> better</c><00:07:43.220><c> than</c><00:07:43.310><c> that</c><00:07:43.550><c> was</c><00:07:43.849><c> on</c><00:07:44.180><c> the</c>

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.300 align:start position:0%
anything better than that was on the

anything better than that was on the

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%

and<00:07:46.520><c> so</c><00:07:47.520><c> I</c><00:07:47.550><c> actually</c><00:07:47.670><c> went</c><00:07:48.030><c> to</c><00:07:48.120><c> I</c><00:07:48.510><c> went</c><00:07:48.720><c> to</c>

some of these things happen and and
 

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.590 align:start position:0%

eventually I thought the idea of

eventually I thought the idea of

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
really cool and the reason I thought
that<00:17:17.510><c> was</c><00:17:17.630><c> because</c><00:17:17.750><c> I</c><00:17:19.179><c> read</c><00:17:20.179><c> a</c><00:17:20.209><c> quote</c><00:17:20.390><c> from</c>

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:20.809 align:start position:0%
that was because I read a quote from
