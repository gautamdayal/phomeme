<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Ever wanted to create a frankenbite or YTP of your favourite character? You must&#39;ve gone through hours of footage
just for a few minutes of dialogue. Well, phoMeme can save all that work. Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<h1 id="worflow">Worflow</h1>
<p>PhoMeme, at a high level, does 5 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Takes in a YouTube link, and a text file with the desired output sentences</li>
<li>Creates a pandas DataFrame to store subtitles with timestamps, and does the same for the input text</li>
<li>Converts English words to standard ARPABET phonemes</li>
<li>Tries matching input words to respective timestamps in the video. If the word is not found, the program searches for individual syllables.</li>
<li>Returns a color-coded file with the input text marked with timestamps to each word/syllable</li>
</ol>
<h1>Sample</h1>
<p>The content of the input text file was 'Happy Birthday Arsh. I had hoped you'd get some rather nice presents,' and the audio subtitles were generated from videos of Michael Rosen speaking. </p>
